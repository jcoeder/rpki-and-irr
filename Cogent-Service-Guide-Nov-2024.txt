 of the registered resource.

 1. Please provide the Cogent port/LAG bundle order ID(s) that require BGP routing:



 2. Autonomous System Number (ASN) - Please check the appropriate box for your network.

    [   ]  I will be announcing my routes to you via ASN(s):  

    [   ]  I need a private ASN to speak BGP at more than one Cogent location, but to no other ISP.
	   Indicate the Cogent Port order numbers for your other locations:


           Customers needing private AS BGP will only be allowed to announce out Cogent IP space.


 3. BGP session password (Optional):  

 4. BGP TTL Security: [  ]
 
	If you want Cogent to enable BGP TTL Security on your eBGP session indicate here.

	You will need to make sure your equipment is configured for BGP TTL Security before enabling 
	the eBGP session to Cogent.  
	
	Please refer to your equipment vendor's documentation to see if your equipment can support this BGP feature.

	For more information on BGP TTL security visit https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5082

 4. If you have an AS-Set registered in an IRR database and would like to have Cogent use it to automatically
    update our prefix lists for your BGP sessions, provide it here:



##########################################################################################################

	Cogent can use the RADB or one of the five Regional Internet Registry IRR database to pull prefixes 
	if you have provided us with an AS-Set. Cogent defaults to RADB as it mirrors most of the major IRR 
	registries. If you would prefer us to pull prefixes from a specific RIR's routing registry, please 
	make note of that in the additional comments section. 
	For a complete list of the databases RADb mirrors, visit http://www.irr.net/docs/list.html#RADB.

 5.  IP Address Blocks to Announce:
     








    Cogent will automatically add 'le 24' tags on IPv4 prefixes, and �le 48� tags on IPv6 prefixes.

 6. BGP Peering Requirements � Select one of the following:

       [   ]  Full
       [   ]  Full (detailed)
          --OR--
       [   ]  Cogent Backbone & Cogent Customer routes
       [   ]  Cogent Backbone & Cogent Customer routes (detailed)
       
          --AND/OR--
       [   ]  Default Route

              Detailed routes are de-aggregated announcements within the Cogent network.


 7.  Remote Trigger Black Hole

	Your eBGP peering with Cogent allows you to blackhole specific IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes.  

	To take advantage of this feature you will need to tag any IP prefixes to be blackholed with the
	specific BGP community of 65535:666.

	If you anticipate needing to blackhole more than 100 IP prefixes contact Cogent Customer Service
	departments as we may need to increase the maximum number of IP prefixes on your eBGP peering 
	sessions.


III.  Bi-directional Forwarding Detection - BFD with BGP

      Cogent offers our customers passive BFD if they would like to configure their equipment for faster reconvergence
      of their BGP sessions to multiple providers.

      We only offer this for BGP sessions across single ports.  This is currently not available if you are aggregating 
      your ports into a LAG/LACP bundle.

      With passive BFD Cogent uses a multiplier value of 3 and a packet interval of 333ms.  You are free to set your
      own values and the Cogent router will use those values.

IV.  Additional vlan setup on a per port basis.

     If you require vlans to separate out bgp peering on a physical port you will be issued a /31 IPv4 and /127 IPv6
     connected blocks.  If you equipment cannot support a /31 IPv4 block and need a /30 IPv4 block, please let your
     sales representitive know and they will generate a free order for an additional /31 IPv4 block which will be 
     combined into a /30 IPv4 block.
